## ❓ Question
What is an object?

### ✅ Answer
An object in JavaScript is a **non-primitive (reference) data type** that stores related data and functions together in key–value pairs.  
The keys are called **properties**, and the values can be **data or functions (methods)**.

### 🔹 Example
```js
const user = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 26,
};
